# Have you started your family 'yet'? Wow, that was early / You'd better get on with it before your ovaries shrivel to walnuts! Oh, and: remember that you're being selfish either way.

A casual conversation this evening with someone I like very much just reminded me of a decidedly less-casual conversation I was once subjected to by someone I like rather less. The latter conversation happened in a pub, for context, at a table full of people I was studying/working with at the time.

By the end my eyes were rolling so far that you could have rolled them back to me twice during the time that this person continued to ignore my non-hidden irritation. I actually love this image. I have used it exactly twice bnefore (to my knowledge), both times quite deliberately and in support for women on twitter whose posts had attracted tediousness/trolls (those are probably be the same thing sometimes...) complaining about them being women, or something. Funny coincidences, right.

Someone I barely knew (at the time) asked me in the course of normal conversation if I was “going to have children soon” (yes, I know, yes). I said something like “I just don’t have that urge. And S and I are having a great time, and I don’t want to share. We’d never be able to have a netflix binge or pursue fine dining or play long board games or go raving all night again. I’m not even broody.” You know, friendly, honest, not-too-serious.

They said: “This is really hard to talk about, but…if all the smart people don’t have children, for reasons like you and more, then just think what young people will be like in 20 or 30 years” ...and then...: “It’s quite selfish of you actually”

[ in my head: errr, pretty sure that 'population planning' (or whatever you dress it up as) like this is quite eugenics-y, which is at very very best selfish if you think you're on the 'winning' (argh) side...and...well let's not even ]

Me: “You can't actually believe that smart people are 'better', that's awful, and yeah this is hard to talk about for a reason!"

[ shocked pause ]
[ then I remember my manners even if the other person seems unencumbered by any ]

Me: 
There are lots and lots of people in the world, far too many actually. We think that maybe later in life we’d consider” [something something teenager, something education, somewhat redacted to avoid even more virtue signalling -- my views on this are easy to ask me about and you're very welcome to] "but honestly at the moment I just don't want to, and my partner feels broadly the same."

Them: “I know you think you can help, but you can’t. Those children are always wayyy beyond help anyway. Even if you adopt a very young child, the damage has been done. You see it everywhere. e.g. [a mutual acquaintance with a young adopted child who has had a few struggles].” [pretty much verbatim....yeah I know]

Me: “Well, being blunt, as apparently that's what we're doing, a child would have a better shot on average being brought up by us, right? Also, /teenager/, /education/, not child-rearing. Also I don't care. You don't go and pick a child off a shelf you know.”

Them: "There are some attachment issues you just can't overcome, even with parenting and education and money. You're being really naive." [argh argh argh]

Me: "Well fine, that's not really relevant to whether or not I want to add a person or people to my family"

Them: “It just seems quite selfish.”

Me: "I'm not just going to agree to have children because you think you're smarter than everyone else"

Going to have to tag Too much of a person now. There are millions of stories like this. Urgh.

Hands up if you're apparently #tooselfish #toonaive #tooprivilegedto, meaning that someone else needs to instruct you as to how to plan the having-a-uterus thing more responsibly...

P.S. Oh, and: I haven't described the other person in this conversation at all, as...how could it improve their position (or manners!). But let's all now breathe a collective sigh of Not Being Surprised that this was a ~30yo white man. It's always either those or the smugly be-child-ed, isn't it :/
