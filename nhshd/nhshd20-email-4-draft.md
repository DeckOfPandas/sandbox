### Hello {{ first_name }},

Thank you so much for coming and taking part in NHS Hack Day #20 at the Royal College of Anaesthetists in London! The weekend would have not have been such a success without you.

### Thank you!

Thanks to everyone who brought along their ideas this weekend; we loved seeing your pitches develop into projects over the weekend and we’re very excited to see where they end up in the future.

We also need to thank our wonderful sponsors, without whom NHS Hack Day #20 would not have been possible:

* The Apperta Foundation (https://apperta.org/) 
* Cortirio (https://cortirio.com/) 
* Health Forge (https://healthforge.io/) 
* Enticify (https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylorlondon/)

Even though we have zero money without sponsorship, we still only work with entities we think are great. Please do check them out.

And of course, we need to say a **huge** thank you to every single person who contributed to making this event happen; whether you were an organiser, an attendee, or a helpful hand to refil the kettle. We couldn’t have done it without you!

### Share the good news!

We hope that you want to share your NHS Hack Day experience with the world. Perhaps you'd like to write a blog post about it? Maybe you took some awesome photos? If you have anything you'd like to share, please send us files or URLs and we'll happily add them to our website (hello@nhshackday.com). We also really like Pull Requests...just saying: https://github.com/nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io

The same goes for any previous NHS Hack Days you’ve attended too. One of our newer goals is to try harder at keeping a growing cache of all NHS Hack Day assets and activities on our website, and we'd love you to be a part of that.

### Tell us about your weekend

Please either send us an email with your thoughts, or fill out this really short feedback form: https://goo.gl/forms/HojDRXx8WFDhN8QH2
