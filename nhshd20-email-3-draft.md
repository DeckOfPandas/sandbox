### Dear {{ first_name }},

It's tomorrow. Royal College of Anaesthetists (https://goo.gl/maps/dR6CLUUiGRu). Arrive between 09:00 and 09:30.

Wave at us on hello@nhshackday.com, the NHSHD Slack, twitter or facebook for help/fun/attention. Details are below.

If you signed up recently, and this is the first email you've had from us, then do read the previous one we sent [here](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas/sandbox/blob/master/nhshd20-email-2-draft.md) to find out more about why we're doing this, our Code of Conduct, and about what "pitching" is this weekend.

Lastly, please bring a mug if not too inconvenient -- it's much nicer not to have to use any more disposable cups than we have to. Do consider bringing one that other people are unlikely to confuse for their own.

# If you only read one bit of this email, make it this bit

**When?**: Saturday 30th June & Sunday 1st July, 09:00 - 18:00 on Saturday, 09:00 - 17:00 on Sunday (not overnight).

**Where?**: Royal College of Anaesthetists, 35 Red Lion Square, London, WC1R 4SG. Handy map: https://goo.gl/maps/dR6CLUUiGRu

**Pitches?**: Warmly encouraged; not expected or required. Sixty seconds. Tell us about a problem in any area of health and care, not your solution to a problem. Read our previous email [here](https://github.com/DeckOfPandas/sandbox/blob/master/nhshd20-email-2-draft.md) with lots more information.

**Can I bring anything helpful?**: Yourself, computer if you want, any extra toys to hack with this weekend. All the cables. If you could arrive at the venue at 08:30 tomorrow bringing along a) a kettle and/or b) machine that turns coffee beans into coffee and/or c) machine that turns ground coffee into coffee, then please contact Helen (via any of the means above, or any other you can think of). To everyone else: do not panic. This plea is important, but an optimisation of a base plan. There will be hot drinks!

**Accessiblity?**: step-free access into the building from the street; step-free route to a lift that serves all floors: step-free access to two sets of toilets (one via the lift) with doorways wide enough to pass a wheelchair. Dedicated quiet space that anyone is free to use any time during the weekend. Additional viewing screens throughout the room during presentations. Sadly no T-loop, signing or stenographer, but all speakers will be amplified.

**Atmosphere?**: Friendly and interested; people like you. Behavioural red-lines are [here](http://nhshackday.com/).

**Food?**: Yes. Lunch both days: omni, vegetarian, vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free food. Snacks and drinks throughout. Not covered by this list? hello@nhshackday.com.

**Can I bring my child(ren)?**: We don't have childcare facilities, but quiet-ish children are welcome to join you (if your group doesn't mind).

**Socialising?**: Yes. Friday and Saturday evenings. See below for details.

**I can't make it**: We're sad. But please do cancel your ticket (attached to this email), or tell hello@nhshackday.com.

**Something else**: hello@nhshackday.com will sort you out

# Sponsors

We would not be able to run these events at all without the kind help of marvellous sponsors who share our vision.

For NHS Hack Day 20, we are particularly grateful to:  
* The Apperta Foundation (https://apperta.org/)
* Cortirio (https://cortirio.com/)
* Health Forge (https://healthforge.io/)
* Enticify ((https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentaylorlondon/)

Even though we have zero money without sponsorship, we still only work with entities we think are great. Please do check them out.



# Talk to us

## That’s all for now!

If you are no longer able to attend next weekend, please cancel your ticket via Tito (your personal ticket link is at the bottom of this email), or let us know and we’ll cancel it for you. Someone else will be happy to take your place, and we hate wasting food.

Please do also let us know if you have any access, dietary or other needs we didn’t pick up in the sign-up process.

See you tomorrow!
